🧩 What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and optimizing inputs (prompts) to guide Large Language Models toward generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

Key Techniques Covered:

Zero-shot prompting

Few-shot prompting

Instruction-based prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting

Prompt refinement and optimization

🔗 What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by LLMs.

Why LangChain?

Without LangChain:

Code becomes repetitive

Prompt management is difficult

Hard to scale LLM applications

With LangChain:

Modular prompt templates

Easy LLM chaining

Memory management

Tool and API integration
